### About Agri Price Dash Board
* For arriving to the price forecast, we used ARIMA, Neural networks and correlation functions. 
* Also done the back test and verified the result for higher accuracy.   

### What STATISTICAL MODEL we Used?
* ARIMA 
* Neural network

### MODEL DESCRIPTION-What Model is about?
#### Statistical model and machine learning algorithm is used for forecasting. 
* ARIMA: Used for time series forecasting using the P, D, Q attributes of it. It is divided in two stages, first stage involves moving average and the second involves auto regression. Both are incorporated for predictive analysis.
* Neural Networks: It consists of Input, hidden and output layer. In this the weight and bias are identified to find the forecast.

### BENEFITS & RESULT Expected
* Predictive analysis with accuracy of 5.121%.

### LIMITATION
* Errors exist in this world, however we have minimized it by using the world best technique.

### FUNCTIONING INFO 
* In the graph, drag the pan below the graph to analyse the period.
* Stretch the pointer in the graph to zoom and double click to zoom out.
